Note

The Factory Method design pattern defines an interface (AbstractProductCreator) for creating an object, 

but let subclasses (derived classes) (ConcreteProductComputerCreator, ConcreteProductLaptopCreator, ConcreteProductMobileCreator) 
decide which class to instantiate.


This pattern lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

here class to instantiate as object are (ConcreteProductComputer, ConcreteProductLaptop, ConcreteProductMobile)


Frequency of use: high
